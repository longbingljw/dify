Dify is an open-source platform for developing LLM applications. Its intuitive interface combines agentic AI workflows, RAG pipelines, agent capabilities, model management, observability features, and more—allowing you to quickly move from prototype to production.
>>>>>>> v1.9.0

English | [简体中文](README_CN.md)

## Backgroud

Beginning in October 2024, we initiated a collaboration with the Dify Team. Given that MySQL is one of the most widely used databases worldwide, many users have expressed a strong desire for Dify to support MySQL. At the same time, owing to OceanBase’s high compatibility with MySQL, we submitted a pull request to the Dify project to introduce MySQL support. However, due to the Dify team’s ongoing commitments to their internal development milestones, they were unable to incorporate this contribution at the time.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Furthermore, through extensive discussions with numerous Dify users, we identified significant demand for several enterprise-level features. Fortunately, OceanBase is capable of delivering these capabilities. As a result, we have continued to maintain and enhance this branch independently to meet these enterprise requirements.
=======
The easiest way to start the Dify server is through [Docker Compose](docker/docker-compose.yaml). Before running Dify with the following commands, make sure that [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) are installed on your machine:
>>>>>>> v1.9.0

## Welcome contribution
We welcome any suggestions and greatly appreciate your contributions.

## Benefits
This branch can provide several enterprise features:
### High Availability
In a production environment, AI platforms must deliver 7x24 uninterrupted service. As the database is a critical component of the entire system, any failure in the database layer can severely disrupt service availability.

<<<<<<< HEAD
OceanBase ensures high availability through the Paxos consensus protocol. When deployed in cluster mode under production conditions, OceanBase remains fully operational even if individual nodes fail. It guarantees a Recovery Point Objective (RPO) of zero and achieves an industry-leading Recovery Time Objective (RTO) of under 8 seconds.

### Scalable
As operational time accumulates, the volume of data stored in the database continues to grow. In legacy systems, once data size exceeds the capacity of a single machine, scaling becomes significantly challenging.
=======
#### Seeking help

Please refer to our [FAQ](https://docs.dify.ai/getting-started/install-self-hosted/faqs) if you encounter problems setting up Dify. Reach out to [the community and us](#community--contact) if you are still having issues.

> If you'd like to contribute to Dify or do additional development, refer to our [guide to deploying from source code](https://docs.dify.ai/getting-started/install-self-hosted/local-source-code)

## Key features

**1. Workflow**:
Build and test powerful AI workflows on a visual canvas, leveraging all the following features and beyond.

**2. Comprehensive model support**:
Seamless integration with hundreds of proprietary / open-source LLMs from dozens of inference providers and self-hosted solutions, covering GPT, Mistral, Llama3, and any OpenAI API-compatible models. A full list of supported model providers can be found [here](https://docs.dify.ai/getting-started/readme/model-providers).

![providers-v5](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/assets/13230914/5a17bdbe-097a-4100-8363-40255b70f6e3)

**3. Prompt IDE**:
Intuitive interface for crafting prompts, comparing model performance, and adding additional features such as text-to-speech to a chat-based app.

**4. RAG Pipeline**:
Extensive RAG capabilities that cover everything from document ingestion to retrieval, with out-of-box support for text extraction from PDFs, PPTs, and other common document formats.

**5. Agent capabilities**:
You can define agents based on LLM Function Calling or ReAct, and add pre-built or custom tools for the agent. Dify provides 50+ built-in tools for AI agents, such as Google Search, DALL·E, Stable Diffusion and WolframAlpha.

**6. LLMOps**:
Monitor and analyze application logs and performance over time. You could continuously improve prompts, datasets, and models based on production data and annotations.

**7. Backend-as-a-Service**:
All of Dify's offerings come with corresponding APIs, so you could effortlessly integrate Dify into your own business logic.

## Using Dify
>>>>>>> v1.9.0

OceanBase, as a distributed database, offers seamless scalability by allowing new nodes to be added to the cluster effortlessly. This enables automatic rebalancing of both data and workload. Moreover, the entire process remains completely transparent to the application.

### AI enhancement
Given that OceanBase also functions as a vector database, it offers powerful hybrid search capabilities. This enables support for multiple data types—including vector data, scalar data (traditional structured data in relational tables), GIS, and full-text content—within a single query.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Such integration enhances both the accuracy and performance of AI-driven queries(Consolidate multiple past queries into a single query and leverage the optimizer to select the optimal execution path), making it particularly valuable for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.
=======
- **Dify for enterprise / organizations</br>**
  We provide additional enterprise-centric features. [Log your questions for us through this chatbot](https://udify.app/chat/22L1zSxg6yW1cWQg) or [send us an email](mailto:business@dify.ai?subject=%5BGitHub%5DBusiness%20License%20Inquiry) to discuss enterprise needs. </br>

  > For startups and small businesses using AWS, check out [Dify Premium on AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-t22mebxzwjhu6) and deploy it to your own AWS VPC with one click. It's an affordable AMI offering with the option to create apps with custom logo and branding.
>>>>>>> v1.9.0

### Reduce Cost
By replacing all databases currently used in Dify—including PostgreSQL, Weaviate, and Redis—with OceanBase, users can achieve more efficient resource utilization and significantly reduce hardware costs.

Furthermore, this consolidation simplifies database operations by eliminating the need to manage three distinct database systems, thereby streamlining maintenance and reducing operational complexity.

<<<<<<< HEAD
### Multi-Tenant
Due to OceanBase's native support for multi-tenancy, Dify users can now try multi-tenant by OceanBase's multi-tenantcy  without compromising Dify’s existing multi-tenant rules.

## Advanced Setup

If you need to customize the configuration, please refer to the comments in our [.env.example](docker/.env.example) file and update the corresponding values in your `.env` file. Additionally, you might need to make adjustments to the `docker-compose.yaml` file itself, such as changing image versions, port mappings, or volume mounts, based on your specific deployment environment and requirements. After making any changes, please re-run `docker-compose up -d`. You can find the full list of available environment variables [here](https://docs.dify.ai/getting-started/install-self-hosted/environments).

If you'd like to configure a highly-available setup, there are community-contributed [Helm Charts](https://helm.sh/) and YAML files which allow Dify to be deployed on Kubernetes.
